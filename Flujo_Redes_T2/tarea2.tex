	\section*{Circular Layout}
	As the name suggest this layout positions nodes in a circle \citep{networkx}. According to \citep{tsay2010hierarchically} although this algorithm can appear trivial, it is widely used to visualize complexes and pathways. The algorithm attempts to minimize the number of overlapping nodes and edges, this way interactions among nodes are easier to understand and locate.  It allows to highlight the node or nodes with the highest degree, moreover it evidences potencially interesting sub-networks as inner circles in the network \citep{agapito2013visualization}.

	\section*{Random Layout}
	This algorithm positions nodes by choosing coordinates uniformly at random on the interval [0.0, 1.0) where the nodes are generated \citep{networkx}. 
	The advantage of this kind of layout lays in the  very  fast drawing on  the  network  graph.  However it carries  the  disadvantage  of  the  difficulty in grasping the position of nodes \citep{mouri2016visualization}.

	\section*{Bipartite Layout}
	This layout positions nodes in two straight lines \citep{networkx}. This particular class only allows the connection between two nodes in different sets \citep{easley2010networks}. Nodes from set X are only connected with nodes from set Y, not with other nodes from X, and vice versa \citep{seminar2014}.

	\section*{Kamada-Kawai Layout}
	Is an algorithm for drawing undirected graphs and weighted graphs and is based on the concept of theoretic distance between nodes \citep{kamada1989algorithm}. In this algorithm the forces between the nodes can be determined by the lengths of shortest paths between each couple of nodes \citep{networkx}. The classical Kamada-Kawai algorithm does not scale well when it is used in networks with large numbers of nodes \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/CheongS15}.
	
	This layout will be represented by an undirected reflexive graph and a directed acyclic multigraph.

	\section*{Shell Layout}
	This layout positions nodes in concentric circles \citep{networkx}. It is also known as concentric layout in \citep{cherven2015mastering}, where it is said that this arrangement in a series of concentric circles is based on the distance from the central node. Thus, nodes with direct connections are arranged in the first circle, then the nodes located at a distance of two nodes away from the center follows in this arrengement and so on, until the graph is completed. The main advantage of this layout is that viewers are able to see network structures easier and to navigate them noticing the closeness of relationships to a single node to each other.
	
	This layout will be represented by a directed cyclic graph and a directed reflexive multigraph.

	\section*{Fruchterman-Reingold Layout}
	This algorithm attempts to distribute vertices evenly, make edge lengths uniform, and reflect symmetry \citep{fruchterman1991graph}. Is best for fewer than thirty
	nodes and does not require parameters to be optimised \citep{gibson2013survey}.
	This layout will be represented by an undirected acyclic multigraph and a directed acyclic graph.

	\section*{Spring Layout}
	This layout positions nodes using the algorithm of Fruchterman-Reingold \citep{networkx}. The algorithm first places the vertices in some initial layout and then it moves the rings in which the system reach a minimal energy due to the spring forces. With this layout we should obtain a display as much symmetry as possible \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1201-3011}.

\newpage
	
	\section*{Spectral Layout}
	This approach has the advantage of computing optimal layouts (according to some requirements) and rapid computation time. It provides an exact solution to the layout problem, whereas other formulations end in an NP-hard problem with approximated solutions \citep{koren2003spectral}. To construct the layout it uses eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the graph and of the Laplacian spectrum associated with the graph \citep{koren2003spectral}. While we use this layout in Python using NetworkX, positioning the nodes, directed graphs will be considered as unidrected graphs \citep{networkx}.

	\section*{Force Atlas 2 Layout}
	Force Atlas 2 is a very fast layout algorithm for force-directed graphs. It's used to spatialize a weighted undirected graph in 2D (Edge weight defines the strength of the connection). The implementation is based on \citep{jacomy2014forceatlas2}. Its really quick compared to the fruchterman reingold algorithm (spring layout) of networkx and scales well to high number of nodes.
